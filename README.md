That's awesome! Cloning Netflix is a great project to practice full-stack development, UI/UX design, and working with APIs. Adding a **README.md** file is an excellent way to document your project and make it more accessible to others (like collaborators or potential employers).

Here’s a sample README template you can use for your Netflix clone:
